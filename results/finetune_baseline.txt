Hypothesis: northern hemisphere will have the most sunlight in summer
True premises:
a hemisphere of earth is a kind of place
the northern hemisphere is a kind of hemisphere of earth
if a place is in summer, then it will have the most sunlight

Predicted premises:
*if a place is in summer, then it will have the most sunlight
summer has the most sunlight
the amount of daylight is greatest in the summer
the amount of daylight is greatest on the summer solstice
the equator receives the most amount of direct sunlight throughout the year
summer is when a hemisphere is tilted towards the sun
june is during the summer in the northern hemisphere
the winter in the southern hemisphere is during the summer in the northern hemisphere
the winter in the northern hemisphere is during the summer in the southern hemisphere
the amount of daylight is least in the winter
snow melts in the summer in an arctic environment
snow melts during the summer in an arctic environment
*the northern hemisphere is a kind of hemisphere of earth
the northern hemisphere is tilted toward the sun
summer is a kind of season
the north pole is located in the northern hemisphere
when a hemisphere is tilted towards the sun , that hemisphere receives more direct sunlight
black objects absorb the most amount of sunlight
the amount of daylight is least on the winter solstice
as the distance of a location from the north pole becomes smaller / closer , the amount of daylight received by that location will increase during the summer
